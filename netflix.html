 <div class="parag"> <p>Where do I even start? I love watching series. One of my favourites and recently watched is breaking bad. I should told you what's it about but if I give you spoilers you will probably hate me forever. If you haven't watched it, now is the time. The second place of my favourite series goes to Prison break. Michael is the CEO of never knowing his next move and i loved watching this show. And the third place I should probably say Money heist od Elite, but this one goes to Friends. Some people say it's overrated or not funny. But i love that show so much. Now that i think about it maybe I should have put Friends on the first place!</p></div>
