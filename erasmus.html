 <div class="parag"> <p>Do you love travelling, exploring new places, meeting new people and love nature? Erasmus+ might be the perfect choise for you, especially if you're young and have no money to travel alone.<br>
    Erasmus+ is the EU's programme to support education, training, youth and sport in Europe. You choose a program, pay for the travel costs, and when you return home all those costs will be reimbursed. All you have to do is <u>save the tickets and send them to your organization</u>.</p>
    <p>Erasmus+ changes my life. Last year I was on a youth exchange in Bremen, Germany. I learned about new cultures and taught them mine. They tries Macedonian's cuisines and they loved them! This youth exchange helped me get out of my comfort zone, try new things, and reveal my creative side.</p>
<p>Here are some photos from the exchange:</p></div>
