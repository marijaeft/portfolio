 <div class="parag"> <p>Now that I think about it, maybe "Narnia obsession" should have been the title of this part! I grew up with stories about Narnia. I couldn't fall asleep when I was little, without hearing the story about Lucy hiding in the closet and discovering Narnia. Then I learned to read in my primary school. The first book I have read... you would never guess it. It was Narnia. Yesterday I watched the films after many years of reading the books, I was so scared that it would ruin my imagination about the faces of Lucy, Edmond, Peter and Susan. And sadly I was right. The books are better and are a must! </p></div>
